    question: Do I need to make an account in order to watch a livestream?
    answer: No, all you need in order to watch a live stream is a valid purchased ticket.  The Eluvio LIVE platform is based on blockchain technology and does not require creating an account, making a subscription, or providing your data.

    key: tickets
    question: Does each event on Eluvio LIVE have its own site and separate ticketing purchase?
    answer: Yes. The Eluvio LIVE platform is created so that each artistic/creative brand and publisher is able to control their own event sites, brand content and offerings. Tickets and merchandise are separately configured and sold by each brand that uses the platform. All sites and experiences ride on the same underlying Eluvio LIVE technology platform, and thus can take advantage of the same features, scaling and streaming capabilities.

    key: connected-tv
    question: Can I watch the livestream on my connected TV ?
    answer: Yes, Eluvio LIVE has released a native application for Apple TV (tvOS). Search the App Store on your Apple TV for the Eluvio LIVE application and install.  Your streaming ticket is redeemable to watch on these platforms, as well as on desktop and mobile browsers. Casting from your laptop or mobile device to a connected TV is also supported but we recommend using a native application for the best performance.

    question: Can my device and bandwidth handle a live stream?
    answer: The EluvioLIVE platform uses an automatic adaptive bit rate technology that will adjust the bandwidth of the stream to your available bandwidth. To view events in 4K quality you will need a downstream Internet bandwidth of 20 Mbps or greater, but if your bandwidth is lower the stream served will automatically adapt for you.

Once you’ve redeemed your ticket, the platform will present an event countdown view, which will automatically offer an option to enter the event a few hours before the event starts.
