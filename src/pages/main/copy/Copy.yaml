    Eluvio LIVE is powered by the Eluvio Content Fabric, the most advanced technology for Internet video. A decentralized, global platform for low latency, high quality content distribution, monetization, and just-in-time asset servicing. With smart contracts rights control, video content is dynamically served from the source as live and on demand streaming as well as dynamic sequences without need for 3rd party services.

    The Eluvio Content Fabric's just-in-time capabilities replace and consolidate the standard functions of live ingest, cloud origin, live transcoding, content management, encryption/DRM, program sequencing, rights and avails controls, direct-to-consumer streaming, and static content distribution. All of this at a dramatically lower cost point, with lower latency, and a naturally greater range of creative experiences than conventional technologies. The platform uses open APIs and a programmable approach for ingest, content distribution, content management, and rights control. All operations are blockchain provable.

    The Content Fabric was invented by a team led by Michelle Munson and Serban Simu, founders of the industry standard Aspera high speed transfer technology (acquired by IBM in 2014) and is currently used by tier 1 Hollywood studios, broadcasters, and mobile streaming providers. The Eluvio Content Fabric was recognized with the 2020 Hollywood Post Alliance Engineering Excellence Award.
