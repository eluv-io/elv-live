    q: Do I need to make an account in order to watch a livestream?
    a: No, all you need in order to watch a live stream is a valid purchased ticket.  The Eluvio LIVE platform is based on blockchain technology and does not require creating an account, making a subscription, or providing your data.
  1:
    q: Does each event on Eluvio LIVE have its own site and separate ticketing purchase?
    a: Yes. The Eluvio LIVE platform is created so that each artistic/creative brand and publisher is able to control their own event sites, brand content and offerings. Tickets and merchandise are separately configured and sold by each brand that uses the platform. All sites and experiences ride on the same underlying Eluvio LIVE technology platform, and thus can take advantage of the same features, scaling and streaming capabilities.
  2:
    q: Can I watch the livestream on my connected TV ?
    a: Yes, Eluvio LIVE has released a native application for Apple TV (tvOS) and Roku. Search the App Store on your Apple TV and the Roku Channel Store for the Eluvio LIVE application and install.  Your streaming ticket is redeemable to watch on these platforms, as well as on desktop and mobile browsers. Casting from your laptop or mobile device to a connected TV is also supported but we recommend using a native application for the best performance.
  3:
    q: Can my device and bandwidth handle a live stream?
    a: The EluvioLIVE platform uses an automatic adaptive bit rate technology that will adjust the bandwidth of the stream to your available bandwidth. To view events in 4K quality you will need a downstream Internet bandwidth of 20 Mbps or greater, but if your bandwidth is lower the stream served will automatically adapt for you.

    q: I purchased a ticket. How do I watch the live event?
    a: You may redeem your ticket anytime by clicking the “Redeem” option in your ticket email, or by using the Redeem Ticket option offered  in the event site on all platforms (desktop and mobile browser), AppleTV and Roku.  Once you’ve redeemed your ticket, the platform will present an event countdown view, which will automatically offer an option to enter the event a few hours before the event starts.
  5:
    q: I purchased a ticket but have not received a ticket email. What should I do?
    a: Ticket emails come from “live@eluv.io”. Check your spam, and if you can’t find the ticket please submit a request to resend the ticket within the “Get Help” option in the bottom toolbar. EluvioLIVE staff monitor support tickets 24x7x365, and we will follow up with you to be sure you have your ticket in hand in time for the event.

    q: What forms of payment are available?
