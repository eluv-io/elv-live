        header: What is this NFT?
        copy: |
          This NFT (non-fungible token) is the first collectible, minted as a contract on the blockchain, to be released by FOX.  As shown in the NFT Details, the NFT was created by FOX Entertainment’s Blockchain Creative Labs in order to celebrate this unique moment in time when animation, technology, and creatives are intersecting as a result of blockchain technology innovation.  Non fungible tokens take advantage of the unique properties of blockchain technology to allow creators to make their digital work of virtually any form available as collectible experiences, in the form of digital tokens that are actually software contracts on a blockchain ledger.  As compared to fungible digital tokens, like crypto currencies (bitcoin, eth, etc.), non-fungible tokens can refer to literally anything -- an image, a video, a physical object, an event ticket, clothing, you name it -- that has value to its creator, and may have value to others.

          The "non fungibility" simply means that no two tokens are interchangeable for one another, such as a unique animation. Most NFTs are minted as standard Ethereum ERC-721 or ERC-1155 contracts, and enjoy the property that the NFT can be directly transferred from the creator owner to a new owner, and to follow on owners using only a blockchain transaction, in software.  The cryptography and security of blockchain technology helps to ensure that both parties are legitimate (have valid, authenticated addresses on the blockchain), that the transfer of funds is sound, and that all transactions are transparent as part of the blockchain's transaction history, which all participants can view.

          NFTs can also collect residual payments for the original creator/owner via the mechanics of the smart contract’s transfer of ownership. Taken together, the NFT innovation allows for a scalable and transparent system for artists to sell collectibles from their creations without middle parties, with options to collect royalties, at Internet scale and with transparency. Hence the excitement about NFTs to transform the creative world is powerful and real, and FOX has taken this first step as a thought leader in the space.

        header: What is the Eluvio Content Fabric?
        copy: |
          The Eluvio Content Fabric is an advanced, open protocol blockchain network purpose- built for digital content. The Fabric allows digital content to be stored, managed, and dynamically composed and served from the source asset, directly to the viewer without any middle systems or parties, and backs all aspects of the content's ownership and access control with blockchain contracts. The Fabric is a very novel invention as content distribution and storage systems are concerned. Its protocol combines just-in-time video transformation and processing, decentralized storage and content routing, and radically efficient re-use of content parts to achieve a truly breakthrough efficiency compared to traditional content storage and distribution systems and compared to proof of work blockchains. It is an ultimately eco efficient and high quality content experience that makes possible creator to audience distribution models at scale for the first time.

          Through a novel compositional and just-in-time protocol, the Fabric makes no file copies and dramatically reduces the storage and network requirements and latencies of traditional digital distribution systems, and avoids the computational costs of proof of work blockchains. Its blockchain characteristics ensure all content is authentic and under the control of its owner, and all audience watch data flows only between audience and content owners or their proxies. This has many benefits including minting NFTs efficiently and directly from <b>any</b> content - not just static images and small videos - and with storage and serving that enforces <b>authenticity</b>, <b>uniqueness</b>, and <b>rarity</b>.

      2:
        header: Why is this NFT minted on the Eluvio Content Fabric - what makes it unique?
        copy: |
          The original animation created for this NFT lives in the Eluvio Content Fabric, and this NFT was minted by the Content Fabric as a uniquely versioned content object having a unique address in the Eluvio blockchain. The Content Fabric solves several of the biggest problems facing NFTs today:  (1) <b>Authenticity</b>. The NFT contract has a direct, inseparable link to the original content object that was used to create it.  The Content Fabric hash is a cryptographic fingerprint that proves that the content referred to by the NFT is actually the same as the original content, and can be verified through an open proof protocol.  The original content stored in the Fabric is also encrypted, and all authorization to it requires a valid blockchain transaction, making the original content tamper free and truly unique.  Most NFTs today refer to storage of the digital content that is unprotected and sometimes, not verifiable.   (2)  <b>Uniqueness</b> and <b>Rarity</b>. Each NFT minted by the Content Fabric is guaranteed unique, as it refers to a unique version of the original content object, minted with a unique issue number among a finite set.  Access to each unique NFT and its viewing experience is enforced through a crypto wallet or a digital ticket code that is cryptographically verified against a blockchain contract that backs the NFT batch and that particular issue number. Your unique issue number is dynamically watermarked into your NFT when you access it with your ticket code or crypto wallet, to display your proof of ownership to others.  (3)  <b>Any Content</b>.  Unlike traditional NFT platforms that require a third party media storage or distribution system to serve the digital content (static images, small videos), the Fabric can render any digital content -- a full length movie, concert, or even a continuous performance -- as an NFT. This opens up virtually unlimited possibilities for collectible experiences. (4) <b>Chain of Ownership</b> and <b>Secondary Payments</b>. Because the Fabric couples the transfer of ownership in NFTs to the content contract it is possible to have any royalty or other payments to creators part of every NFT transaction, and to enforce this in the availability of the content itself.

        header: How do I add this NFT to my crypto wallet?
        copy: |
          Your NFT is stored on the Eluvio Content Fabric blockchain. For ease of use, your NFT is secured by a digital access code (the code you received), which is acting as a proxy for a crypto wallet.

          You may revisit this URL at any time to access your NFT via your ticket code. The Eluvio Content Fabric is a fully Ethereum compatible blockchain and also offers the ability to transfer your NFT to the Ethereum mainnet, which will allow you to add it to any crypto wallet with an Ethereum mainnet address.  To transfer your NFT to an Ethereum mainnet address, follow the Transfer workflow to enter your mainnet address in the specified area, and select Transfer.  The Content Fabric will confirm your request, transfer the NFT to a 721 contract on Ethereum mainnet, owned by the address you specify. When this process completes, you will receive an email notification with the contract address and an etherscan.io URL for viewing the transaction.  This process will also create the necessary metadata for your NFT to be viewed on OpenSea. The OpenSea URL will be returned in an email confirmation.

          For a limited period the gas charges for the Transfer processing will be covered by FOX (see terms and conditions). Once the promotion ends, you will need to connect your own cryptowallet to fund the Transfer transaction.  FOX has encoded in this NFT a residual fee of 10% that will credit to a FOX Ethereum mainnet address on future sales.

        Eluvio LIVE is powered by the Eluvio Content Fabric, the most advanced technology for Internet video. A decentralized, global platform built on blockchain, the Fabric provides low latency, high quality (4K) content distribution, content monetization, and just-in-time streaming. Under the control of blockchain smart contracts, video content is dynamically served from the source as live and on demand streaming as well as dynamic sequences without need for 3rd party services.

        The Eluvio Content Fabric's just-in-time capabilities replace and consolidate the standard functions of live ingest, cloud origin, live transcoding, content management, encryption/DRM, program sequencing, rights and avails controls, direct-to-consumer streaming, and static content distribution. All of this at a significantly lower cost point, with lower latency, and a naturally greater range of creative experiences than conventional technologies. The platform uses open APIs and a programmable approach for ingest, content distribution, content management, and rights control. All operations are blockchain provable.

        The Content Fabric was invented by a team led by Michelle Munson and Serban Simu, founders of the industry standard Aspera high speed transfer technology (acquired by IBM in 2014) and is currently used by tier 1 Hollywood studios, broadcasters, and mobile streaming providers. The Eluvio Content Fabric was recognized with the 2020 Hollywood Professional Association Engineering Excellence Award.

        2020 brought many profound and irreversible changes to the content creation industry. The challenges and opportunity of the global pandemic dramatically accelerated many trends, such as the monetization of deep libraries, remote and online production; the creation of self service properties for selling, screening, licensing and servicing; direct-to-audience models including no-windows streaming releases; fully virtual live performances and broadcasts and the complete virtualization of marketing, pre-release screening, and advertising sales.

        Perhaps most significant of all, the end of 2020 and early 2021 brought the first mainstream monetization of content on the blockchain with the release of the first high value NFTs created from digital art, digital collectible communities for fans, and the first direct-to-consumer content distribution models backed by blockchain ticketing and sales. We are fortunate to be part of this, and have helped to enable the first just-in-time supply chains with our customers in their drive to fully digitize, transform costs, and embrace the power of blockchain economics to create significant new revenue opportunities for premium content.

        Our involvement with organizations such as ETC, HPA, SMPTE, NIVA, EVR1, SXSW, and the Blockchain Xcelerator, influence from major established media companies, labels and bands, and input from various independent creators have helped us to grow the Content Fabric platform—a blockchain controlled real-time content storage and distribution network—to a point of scale and practical decentralization for our user community. The Content Fabric’s blockchain is the foundation of this capability.

    background:
      header: Technology Background
      text: |
        The Content Fabric is a content blockchain. Formally, the Fabric is a decentralized application platform (DAPP) for just-in-time low latency, high quality content distribution, monetization, and asset servicing. The platform is purpose-built to serve content at scale, eliminating the need for individual cloud transcoding services, aggregation, content management, and CDNs. The nodes in the network all run the same open, bipartite, and decentralized protocol which is both a blockchain and a content storage and distribution protocol that are intimately linked. The protocol is original but is inspired by innovations in content centric routing, just-in-time pipelined processing and assembly (code ‘in object’), decentralized consensus, ML, and trustless crypto.

        The Content Fabric protocol serves active video content directly from source objects as live and on-demand streaming, with dynamic sequences and transformations, as well as static imagery and data, all under the control of blockchain contracts that secure access to and versioning of the content. This decentralized and dynamic protocol is executing on nodes implemented in a global network and effectively replaces and consolidates many conventional functions including: live ingest, cloud origin, live transcoding, content management, encryption/DRM, program sequencing, rights and avails control, CDN streaming, and static content distribution.

        Nodes may be public, serving end clients, or function privately in the network for publishing only and execute the protocol under the control of a node contract that authenticates, authorizes, and certifies their work. Nodes are typically peered directly with all of the major public clouds (AWS, Azure, GCP), allowing for local ingest from cloud storage buckets, and have high capacity (multi-terabit/second) IP transit capacity for direct ingest of live content and distribution of streaming and static content to audiences.

        **How does it work?**

        The Content Fabric creates and serves output such as adaptive bit rate streaming manifests and segments, and static content through a just-in-time process that executes within the nodes in the network. This process relies on a low-level decentralized data storage and distribution protocol and a componentized object representation of media essence, metadata, and code called a “content object”.  The content object is a data structure composed of references to the cryptographic hash signatures of the binary “parts” that comprise the object.

        The protocol does the following:

        - On ingest - master file media, assets, data, or streams — are decomposed into such parts, distributed throughout the network, and an object is created. Any re-use of the parts within an object is by reference - rather than by copy - and common bytes are copied only on update.

        - This is carried through rendering, such that all re-rendered output is built from parts, avoiding all file copy representations through the network and in storage for efficiency.

        - A fast part routing algorithm allows for parts to be found in the network in real-time and supports just-in-time transcoding, packaging, and extensible A/V processing within the protocol.

        See [Content Fabric Architecture](/technology#architecture) and [How it Works](/technology#how_it_works) for a detailed description of this process.

    blockchain_protocol:
      header: Blockchain Protocol
      text: |
        The publishing, update, and access to content occurs via the Fabric blockchain, and is a blockchain protocol. The life cycle of content is controlled by a decentralized publish and commit process that results in the entire content version history being stored in the blockchain, and all access to write or read content being authorized through a blockchain transaction (either off or on-chain), and recorded as events on the blockchain.

        All content parts are encrypted for the owner and under the control of a blockchain contract that is part of each object. All actors in the system - content owners, content accessors, and nodes - identify and authenticate themselves in the network using blockchain authentication, and all content encryption uses a trustless re-encryption from blockchain cryptography. Taken together multiple owners can safely store their content in the same network and without trusting the nodes in the network.

        Content is also self-verifiable in this protocol: the cryptographic hash of each object is a merkle hash of the parts of the object. It is committed in a contract transaction whenever a version change occurs, ensuring that the “parts” that make up the object are verifiable throughout the network. Any reading client can verify content by calculating a fast version hash proof.

        The blockchain protocol is fully Ethereum compatible and the smart contracts are EVM based and standards compliant (ERC 721 and ERC 1155). Additionally, Eluvio has taken significant effort to ensure that the architecture is designed for interoperability with other blockchains via the Web3 and Inter-Blockchain Communication design philosophy. The APIs allow for transferring the contracts backing content or non-fungible tokens minted from content between the Content Fabric and other blockchains. All contracts and the client-side APIs are open source.

        The Content Fabric blockchain is proof-of-authority based and uses a standard blockchain consensus protocol from the Ethereum community [EIP-225 “clique” based proof-of-authority](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-225) that relies on the agreement of a subset of nodes in the network designated as validators. There is no proof-of-work in this system therefore the efficiency of the consensus avoids the problems of proof-of-work blockchains. But, for true decentralization the validator nodes need to represent a decentralized community of those using the network.

        This protocol is open and extensible—new nodes may be added at any time and without impacting the running of the network. Up until Fall 2021, all validator nodes in the Content Fabric have been owned by Eluvio. As of Fall 2021, a charter group of validator nodes are being added to the network by some of our key partners and users including major media companies in film and TV, nonprofits representing artists, and digital merchandising companies specializing in music and other entertainment industries. This charter membership also holds the first governance tokens in the network and is actively part of the building the governance policies of the Content Fabric network.

        The Eluvio Content Fabric is a utility blockchain network for owner controlled storage, distribution, and monetization of digital content at scale over the public Internet. Through its protocol, it provides the **essential utility functions** for premium media such as encrypted content storage, transcoding (to generate consumable output media), egress bandwidth distribution, internal transmission (in publishing), minting of NFTs, and issuing/redemption of one-time and persistent passcodes (“tickets”).

        These essential utility functions are complemented by additional **application-specific utility** functions such as forensic watermarking, application of digital rights management, automated machine learning tagging of content, content search, dynamic clipping, content download/archiving, and others.

        A network of **Nodes** all run the same Content Fabric protocol software, and thus carry out these utility functions on behalf of Content Owners. Each Node has a contract address allowing it to be compensated for processing transactions for these utility functions.

        Some nodes are **Validator Nodes** that specifically validate the Fabric blockchain transactions on behalf of the network. These Nodes currently run a proof-of-authority based consensus protocol (adapted Ethereum Clique), but also participate in the network with their own governance contracts, and are being staked in Fall 2021 with the addition of several external validator nodes and a charter governance structure.

        **Content Owners** use these utility services to reach their **Viewers** in order to gain and hold their attention. Viewers gain access to view/experience the Content directly via the Content Fabric. The Fabric serves media to authorized Viewers directly by default. It can also be used to serve it to proxies (content delivery networks/headends, etc. that in turn serve the content to the Viewer).

        Viewers obtain an authorization token to view/experience content (through the Fabric’s trustless owner-to-reader encryption model) via a successful blockchain transaction. This transaction can be off-chain (“state channel”) where appropriate for low risk, modest value transactions, or on-chain for high value (e.g. publishing) operations.

        The Content Owner thus either directly authorizes the Viewer to access the Content via the Fabric’s capabilities or indirectly through an authorized proxy.

        Because the Viewer gains authorization to experience/view Content on the Fabric via a blockchain transaction, the Viewer is explicitly in control of any exchange of value for his/her attention to the Content.

        **Content Owners** may sell to third parties (**Advertisers**) the option to present content to the Viewer alongside the primary content and the ability to offer Viewers value in exchange for their data.

        All **Viewers** access content through a **one-time blockchain transaction (ticket**) or through a **persistent wallet-based transaction**. The wallet is a cryptographically secure and authenticated store for the Viewer’s private data and private transaction keys.

        The above relationships between Nodes, Validator Nodes, Content Owners, and Advertisers are currently implemented as a Tenancy within a **Space** in the Content Fabric. A Space is a collection of content objects owned by one or more Content Owners. The group of content objects owned by a specific Content Owner and the access groups and policies for accessing these is a Tenant, and the Space is a collection of Tenants that all follow the same general security groups and quality of service guarantees.

        Today’s production Content Fabric operates a single active space (Active Space 1), but the implementation allows for the addition of more Spaces that would allow for different classes of security and levels of distribution service as the platform grows.

        **Future Proof and Extensible**

        A final comment on this architecture and the primary actors and roles within: today’s Content Fabric is built on an Ethereum-standards based blockchain architecture and EVM contracts and uses a proof-of-authority Clique based protocol (no proof of work), with state-channel authorization where appropriate for speed in consumer media access. The Fabric architecture allows for any blockchain with functional Turing-complete contracts and layer 1 scaling to be slotted into the same role, so that the Fabric can continue to evolve without disrupting its basic principles and allowing it to federate with other chains for interoperability and fungibility. Specifically, the Fabric has followed open source Ethereum contract standards (ERC 20, ERC 721, ERC 1155, etc.) and is architected for interoperability via inter-blockchain communication principles, a la parachains. **It is fast, ecological, standards-based, and flexible for the rapidly evolving future for blockchain technologies and currencies.**

    metering:
      header: Tokens and Metering

        ## ELV
        The basic unit of value in the Content Fabric Blockchain is a token for counting Essential and Application-specific utilities the Nodes perform for Content Owners by running the Content Fabric protocol. This token is called the “elv” and is represented by the three-letter acronym **ELV**.

        Content Owners who are tenants on the Content Fabric indirectly purchase ELVs in order to utilize Content Fabric services. All utility “work” done by the Content Fabric Nodes for Content Owners is metered internally in an abstract unit of work. This value is a unit of utility output—like a kilowatt-hour in an electricity grid—that is used as a normalized measure of the utility’s value and covers work such as performing units of compute in minting or transcoding, egress bandwidth for streaming, and content storage.

        The relative unit values are selected to reflect the actual cost of providing these services and will naturally change over time. **One of the great advantages of the Content Fabric as a storage and distribution network is that many of the artificial costs of traditional multi-stage, cloud, and CDN storage and distribution systems are removed.** The actual costs are reduced to the raw costs of providing these resources. Unlike many other blockchain platforms, the costs and capabilities are well understood and market-proven based on the past 18 months in production serving content to global audiences.


        ## Service Charging and Governance
        Internally, the Content Fabric today computes the work done by Nodes on behalf of Content Owners, which determines the charge back to Content Owners against their service plan. Service plan rates are in US dollars / fiat with a fixed internal ELV rate ($1/ELV) as of Fall 2021.  As the governance program ramps up, the ELV rate will move toward a rate that adjusts with the actual work costs and will be guided by the governance entities, all of which are users or partners in the network. This exchange of work for ELVs also provides an opportunity to compensate Nodes for their utility work.
        The tokenization framework described here begins decentralized governance with participation from 3rd parties. This provides the review and decentralized input to manage the value of the ELV to utility work exchange rate as the Content Fabric continues to scale.

        As of Fall 2021, the Tokenization Framework designates two pools within the pool of ELV tokens: ELV-1, which is the general pool used to compensate Node owners for utility work from Content Owners as Tenants, and ELV-G, which is used to compensate Validator nodes for validating transactions carried out in providing the utility work. The ELV-G class is a small proportion of the total ELV pool in circulation. It rewards Validators and transitions their holdings to a convertible stake in the value of the Content Fabric network as the platform grows and the use of ELV scales, naturally moving to a convertible status.


        ## Content Tokens

        Each Content Owner as a Tenant on the Fabric has the option to create a **tenant-specific token to assign value to Viewer interaction with their Content** via these utility services. This tenant-specific token type is implemented as an ERC-20 token backed by the ELV. This token is, in essence, an Attention Token for that Tenant’s Content. It can be used to measure, incentivize, and monetize Viewer attention to the Tenant’s content. The specific use cases and the exchange value to ELVs is under the Tenant’s control, allowing Content Owners to create media applications where Viewers can consume and interact with their content with low-cost and brand-based liquidity.

        In the upcoming months, Eluvio will be releasing capabilities—using new parachain features in Layer 1 blockchains—to allow creators and publishers to sell NFTs and other media experiences to their Viewers in tenant-specific tokens as well as fiat currencies with very low cost transaction fees. The Content Fabric makes it super-easy and efficient for Content Owners to mint NFTs both for collectibles and for content access, with many advantages over existing platforms.

      header: NFTs
      text: |
        The Content Fabric automatically mints NFTs (ERC 721 and 1155) from any content object as a native function and as a uniquely versioned content object having a unique address in the Eluvio blockchain. Any token is ultimately open and transferable to Ethereum mainnet or other parachain based blockchains. **Unlike other blockchains for NFTs, the Content Fabric has a strong link between the media asset and the contract,** it is fast and ultra-efficient, and avoids several fundamental problems while providing many new opportunities for ‘tokenizing’ media experiences.The rising demand for full length and higher value video experiences as NFTs have revealed problems around **authenticity, uniqueness, rarity, chain of ownership, user experience, and cost/minting efficiency** that stem from or at least relate to the inefficiencies of many blockchain platforms for media operations and the weak link between NFTs as contracts and the media assets to which they refer (usually stored, managed, and rendered in separate storage systems such as IPFS or cloud storage). These limitations do not matter much for low value game tokens (e.g. crypto kitties). But, as we have seen, whole albums released as NFTs were copied without limit ('curl' from S3) and video series sold for thousands of dollars per 'rare' NFT episode were available to watch for free on YouTube the next day, all the while requiring large gas fees to mint.

        ## Unique Features for NFTs

        **Authenticity**: The NFT contract has a direct, inseparable link to the original content object that was used to create it. The Content Fabric hash is a cryptographic fingerprint that proves that the content referred to by the NFT is actually the same as the original content, and can be verified through an open proof protocol. The original content stored in the Fabric is also encrypted and all authorization to it requires a valid blockchain transaction, making the original content tamper free and truly unique. Most NFTs today refer to storage of the digital content that is unprotected and, sometimes, not verifiable.

        **Uniqueness and Rarity**: Each NFT minted by the Content Fabric is guaranteed unique, as it refers to a unique version of the original content object, minted with a unique issue number among a finite set. Access to each unique NFT and its viewing experience is enforced through a crypto wallet or a digital ticket code that is cryptographically verified against a blockchain contract that backs the NFT batch and that particular issue number. A unique issue number can be dynamically watermarked into your NFT when accessed with a ticket code or crypto wallet to display proof of ownership to others.

        **Any Content**: Unlike traditional NFT platforms that require a third party media storage or distribution system to serve the digital content (static images, small videos), the Fabric can render any digital content—a full length movie, concert, or even a continuous performance—as an NFT. This opens up virtually unlimited possibilities for collectible experiences.

        **Chain of Ownership and Secondary Payments**: Because the Fabric couples the transfer of ownership of NFTs to the content contract, it is possible to have any royalty or other payments to creators part of every NFT transaction and to enforce this in the availability of the content itself.

        **User Experience:** All NFTs are content objects that can be directly authorized and displayed in user wallets as a native media experience (video/audio streaming, resizing, live, continuous, with metadata, etc.) avoiding all separate content storage and streaming systems. Key management can be delegated to the Fabric avoiding the challenges of tedious crypto wallets. Gamified functions such as spawning, burning, trait mixing, branching stories, and permissioned offerings are natively supported by the Fabric’s dynamic content serving and blockchain permissioning.

        **Low Cost/Gasless Minting:** Minting is an automatic, low-cost operation in the Content Fabric that is gas-less by design and extends to minting tokens for any content experience that the Fabric renders.

    questions:
      header: Common Questions
      text: |
        ## How are the transactions reported, ala etherscan?
        All Content Fabric operations are recorded in the Content Fabric blockchain ledger and visible through its [open ledger event log](https://explorer.contentfabric.io). Any contract operations on the Ethereum mainnet such as transferring an NFT from the Fabric blockchain to mainnet are standard Ethereum transactions visible in Etherscan.

        ## How are your NFTs minted, displayed, and sold?
        NFTs are mintable and viewable as content objects served by the Content Fabric APIs and can be rendered as streamed or static content. This allows any browser, mobile, or connected TV application or marketplace to embed NFT minting and viewing directly into its experience using any standard browser UX,streaming player, or end-user wallet. Similarly, NFTs are a “sku”-based content object that can be embedded in any checkout and payment experience.

        ## What wallets are compatible with your platform?

        The Content Fabric is Ethereum compatible and thus Metamask and other Ethereum compatible wallets can be used to manage accounts on it. Stay tuned for more news on native wallets.

        ## Where are your smart contracts, specific for content creators? If so, what do they look like in regards to content? How do you enforce them?

        All contracts in [open source](https://github.com/eluv-io/contracts). They are deployed in the [production content fabric](https://main.net955305.contentfabric.io/config) and are continually extended to add new functionality. All APIs are available on GitHub, particularly the [elv-client-js APIs](https://github.com/eluv-io/elv-client-js)
