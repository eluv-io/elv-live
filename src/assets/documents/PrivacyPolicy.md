**Eluvio Privacy Policy**

**Effective Date: March 18th, 2021**

This Eluvio Privacy Policy (this "**Policy**") describes how we treat personal information we collect both online and offline. This includes on our websites and in our apps, if applicable, as well as any phone or email interactions you may have with us.


1. 
**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">What Information We Collect and Where We Get It</span>. **
_We collect the following information from and about you_:

**Contact, billing and device information**. When you create an account and/or purchase a ticket to view a streaming exhibition on the Eluvio platform, we and/or our payments processor (which is currently Stripe) will collect your contact and billing information, such as your name, street address, zip code, email, phone number and credit card number.  We will store your email address only temporarily in order to resolve support issues that  may arise before, during, or after the streaming event for which you have purchased a ticket, for so long as the event remains available for viewing pursuant to the terms of the applicable ticket. We will also temporarily store your device information, including IP address, device ID, and user agent, in order to determine the quality of your experience and to provide technical support as described above. This device-related information will be deleted after the support period for your ticketed event ends. Similarly, after the support period ends with regard to your ticketed event, we will delete your email address and viewing information and will retain only anonymized usage logs under the form of counters and platform utilization.  Any payment information retained by our payments processor will be subject to that third party’s privacy policy.  

**Information you post**. We collect information you post in a public space on our website or on a third-party social media site.

**Demographic information**. We might collect information like your age range, race, or gender, or information about events you like or products you buy. We might collect this as part of a survey, for example.

**Accessibility Information**. We may collect details of your health requirements if you have accessibility requirements when accessing or viewing streaming events.

**Other information**. We may collect information about the browser and device you're using, your IP address, your location, the site you came from, the site you visit when you leave us, and how you used or didn't use our site. We may collect this using technology such as GPS and Wi-Fi.

_We collect information in different ways_:

**We collect information directly from you**. For example, if you buy tickets or register for an account. We also collect information if you post a comment on our websites or ask us a question.

**We collect information from you passively**. We use tracking tools like browser cookies and web beacons. 

**We get information about you from third parties**. For example, if you use a social media feature within our websites or apps or post to a social media platform, the social media site will give us some information about you.



2. 
**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">How We Use Your Information and Why</span>. **
**We use information to provide you with products and services**. We use your information to process your order and provide you with customer support. This includes sending you emails about your account or a ticket purchase. We might also contact you about this policy or our website terms.

**We use information to respond to your requests or questions**. For example, we might use your information to confirm your registration for an event.

**We use information to improve our products and services**. We might use your information to customize your experience with us. This could include displaying content based upon your preferences.

**We may use your information to make our website, products, and services better**. We may combine information we get from you with information about you that we get from third parties.

**We use information for security purposes**. We use information to protect our company, our customers, and our websites. This includes to detect or prevent unlawful behavior.

**We use information for marketing purposes**. For example, we might send you information about special promotions or offers. We might also tell you about new features or products. These might be our own offers or products, or third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting.  If you wish to opt out of any of these, you may email us at privacy@eluv.io.

**We use information as otherwise permitted by law or as we may notify you.**

**We keep your information as long as it is necessary or relevant for our business**. We also keep information to resolve disputes, enforce our agreements and as otherwise required by law.



3. 
**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Who We Share Your Data With and Why</span>.  **
_We may share information with third parties._

**We will share information with third parties who perform services on our behalf**. For example, we share information with vendors who provide billing services or who fulfill your merchandise purchases. Some vendors may be located outside of the United States.

**We will share information with our business partners**. This includes a third party who provides an event, such as the artist, promoter or team, who sponsors an event, or who operates a venue where an event is filmed. Our partners use the information we give them as described in their privacy policies, which may include sending you marketing communications. You should read those policies to learn how they treat your information.  Information provided under this section may include how many tickets you purchased, how many streams you viewed, and the duration of your streaming sessions.

**We may share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves**. For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena. We may also share information if a government agency or investigatory body requests it. Or, we might also share information when we are investigating potential fraud.

**We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business**. For example, if part of our business is sold we may provide our customer list as part of that transaction.

**We may share your information for reasons not described in this policy**. We will tell you before we do this.
