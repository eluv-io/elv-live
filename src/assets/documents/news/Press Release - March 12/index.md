**BERKELEY, CA – March 18, 2021** – Today at
[SXSW](https://www.sxsw.com),
Eluvio unveiled Eluvio LIVE
([https://live.eluv.io/](https://live.eluv.io)),
a novel streaming and ticketing platform, for concerts and all manner of
premium exhibitions, distributed directly from artists to their global
audiences. Built on the patented Eluvio Content Fabric, it is the
world’s first 4K video streaming and ticketing service with all content
secured and sold via blockchain contracts– with no distribution or
content management fees.  

The Content Fabric is the first blockchain-based scalable content
distribution network for premium video. Launched in 2019 and used by
Tier 1 media companies such as [MGM
Studios](www.prnewswire.com) and
[FOX
Networks](https://www.mesaonline.org/2020/05/14/eluvio-a-new-age-of-video-distribution) and
mobile streaming providers, the platform was invented by a team led by
Michelle Munson and Serban Simu, the multi-Emmy® award winning founders
and inventors of Aspera, a pioneer in digital video transport technology
that was acquired by IBM. The Content Fabric platform was recently
awarded the prestigious 2020 Engineering Excellence Award by the
Hollywood Professional Association; the 2020 "Best Use of Blockchain in
Media Award" by Cable and Satellite International, and the "IBC 2020
Best of Show Award" from TV Technology. 

Now, Eluvio LIVE opens the Content Fabric’s transformational technology
to artists and publishers, allowing them to enjoy low-latency,
owner-controlled content distribution directly to their fans, through
highly customizable event sites and digital experiences. The platform
provides high quality, low latency streaming to AppleTV, Roku, mobile
and browser platforms, and built-in geofencing, dynamic personalization,
digital NFT (non-fungible token) creation and merchandising for
concerts, performances, sporting events, movie screenings or premieres.
Live content is automatically recorded and reusable on demand, and it
can be refashioned and remonetized to support new events, creative
collaborations, sponsorships, and availability windows.

“Eluvio LIVE was created to address the fundamental shifts taking place
right now across the music and entertainment industries,” said Michelle
Munson, CEO and co-founder of Eluvio. “Artists and publishers want to
reach audiences anywhere in the world, in a way that gives them the
highest levels of financial control, video quality, and customization.
The global shift towards streaming live events, necessitated by the
pandemic, will become a permanent way to amplify in-person performances
when they return, and the opportunity for artists to control their
content destiny via blockchain technology has come together in a unique
moment. Eluvio LIVE will enable these ‘multi-experiential’ viewing
opportunities to reach beyond the confines of physical venues, and
unlock the ability of artists and publishers to continually monetize
their content.”

The initial series of major concerts on Eluvio LIVE will be filmed and
produced by iconic [Paramax
Films](http://www.paramaxfilms.com/about.html),
which will provide the content into the Eluvio LIVE platform. “Eluvio
LIVE is the perfect complement to live production and filming companies
like ours,” said Amos Rozenberg, CEO of Paramax Films. “Today’s artists
and producers critically need a platform they can control, that is both
high quality and scalable, and more versatile and profitable to
distribute and monetize their performances, and Eluvio LIVE is a
breakthrough on all of those fronts.”
