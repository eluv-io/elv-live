 * 
 * @constant {number} EXP_FACTOR - Exponential Factor
 * Doesn't matter much as it's the exponential nature that counts. Chose 2 as it's a nice round number. 
 *
 * @constant {number} MAX_RETRIES - Maximum Retry Limit
 * Need more testing to find optimal retry limit
 * 
 * @constant {string} JITTER_OPTION - Jitter Configuration 
 * Addresses thundering herd problem by adding some amount of random “jitter” to each request's exponential backoff (initial_delay * exp_factor ^ retry_count)

 *    2. EqualJitter: Randomized range between (delay * .5) and (delay * 1.5) => exponential_backoff/2 + random_between(0, exponential_backoff)
