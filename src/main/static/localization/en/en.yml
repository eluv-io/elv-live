    text: |
      Through a novel compositional and just-in-time protocol, the [Eluvio Content Blockchain](/content-fabric/blockchain) does not make digital file copies and dramatically reduces the network storage and usage requirements significantly as compared to today’s traditional streaming and content distribution systems.

      It also uses an eco-friendly consensus, which avoids the high energy consumption of computational “proof-of-work” blockchains. And the digital content itself, not just the token is owned on the blockchain so your digital assets are exclusive to you.

  header: The Technology behind the Content Fabric
  text: |
    Eluvio LIVE is powered by the [Eluvio Content Fabric](/content-fabric), the most advanced technology for Internet video. A decentralized, global platform built on blockchain, the Fabric provides low latency, high quality (4K) content distribution, content monetization, and just-in-time streaming. Under the control of blockchain smart contracts, video content is dynamically served from the source as live and on demand streaming as well as dynamic sequences without need for 3rd party services. The Eluvio Content Fabric's just-in-time capabilities replace and consolidate the standard functions of live ingest, cloud origin, live transcoding, content management, encryption/DRM, program sequencing, rights and avails controls, direct-to-consumer streaming, and static content distribution. All of this at a significantly lower cost point, with lower latency, and a naturally greater range of creative experiences than conventional technologies. The platform uses open APIs and a programmable approach for ingest, content distribution, content management, and rights control. All operations are blockchain provable. The Content Fabric was invented by a team led by Michelle Munson and Serban Simu, founders of the industry standard Aspera high speed transfer technology (acquired by IBM in 2014) and is currently used by tier 1 Hollywood studios, broadcasters, and mobile streaming providers. The Eluvio Content Fabric was recognized with the 2020 Hollywood Professional Association Engineering Excellence Award.

      label: Our Blockchain
      text: |
        2020 brought many profound and irreversible changes to the content creation industry. The challenges and opportunity of the global pandemic dramatically accelerated many trends, such as the monetization of deep libraries, remote and online production; the creation of self service properties for selling, screening, licensing and servicing; direct-to-audience models including no-windows streaming releases; fully virtual live performances and broadcasts and the complete virtualization of marketing, pre-release screening, and advertising sales.

        Perhaps most significant of all, the end of 2020 and early 2021 brought the first mainstream monetization of content on the blockchain with the release of the first high value NFTs created from digital art, digital collectible communities for fans, and the first direct-to-consumer content distribution models backed by blockchain ticketing and sales. We are fortunate to be part of this, and have helped to enable the first just-in-time supply chains with our customers in their drive to fully digitize, transform costs, and embrace the power of blockchain economics to create significant new revenue opportunities for premium content.

        Our involvement with organizations such as ETC, HPA, SMPTE, NIVA, EVR1, SXSW, and the Blockchain Xcelerator, influence from major established media companies, labels and bands, and input from various independent creators have helped us to grow the Content Fabric platform—a blockchain controlled real-time content storage and distribution network—to a point of scale and practical decentralization for our user community. The Content Fabric’s blockchain is the foundation of this capability.
