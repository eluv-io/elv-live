Our Privacy Policy is also incorporated herein by reference. &nbsp;By clicking &ldquo;I agree&rdquo; below or in any other way visiting the Platform or using the Platform Services, you expressly agree to this Agreement, as well as the Privacy Policy. The Parties hereby agree as follows:Currency. &nbsp;All ticket prices for events are stated in U.S. Dollars.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c3 lst-kix_list_2-0 start" start="2">
  <li class="c2"><h3>Payment</h3><span class="c7">All payments for Platform Services that you choose to purchase via the Platform will be conducted through our digital payments&nbsp;providers (such as&nbsp;Stripe). &nbsp;By agreeing to purchase Platform Services, you also agree to&nbsp;the digital payments provider&rsquo;s&nbsp;Terms of Service, such as Stripe&rsquo;s, which can be found&nbsp;</span><span class="c11"><a class="c14" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/url?q%3Dhttps://stripe.com/payment-terms/legal%26sa%3DD%26source%3Deditors%26ust%3D1626810139088000%26usg%3DAOvVaw29K4d7HtcOujKfCZ8y3Jnt&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1634150882255000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Itk07iV6mA9I6tAa26uQ6">here</a></span><span class="c7">. &nbsp;All fees and other amounts payable in connection with your purchase of Platform Services as listed on the Platform are exclusive of taxes and similar assessments, which will be added by&nbsp;the digital payments vendor&nbsp;during the checkout process.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c3 lst-kix_list_3-0 start" start="3">
  <li class="c2"><h3>Event Production</h3>We make the Platform Services available to the customers of persons and entities (each, an &ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c12">Event Organizer</span><span class="c7">&rdquo;) that produce and/or offer streaming exhibitions of all kinds, whether live (real-time), pre-recorded, or a combination/hybrid thereof, and including but not limited to live performances, sporting events, feature length movies, television episodes and series, or combinations of any of the above, such as artists, venues, teams, fan clubs, promoters, and leagues. By initiating any transactions via the Platform Services, including but not limited to viewing a given streaming exhibition (the &ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c12">Event</span><span class="c7">&rdquo;), you agree and acknowledge that the Event Organizer and/or the associated talent is responsible for producing the content of the Event.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c3 lst-kix_list_4-0 start" start="4">
  <li class="c2"><h3>Pricing</h3>We generally sell Event tickets in one of two price tiers: the lower being HD streaming and the higher being 4K streaming. &nbsp;If you wish to purchase a 4K ticket, you are solely responsible for determining in advance of your purchase whether your viewing device and/or Internet connectivity supports 4K streaming. No refunds will be issued for 4K tickets that are not able to be fully utilized due to equipment or connectivity issues for which Eluvio is not responsible. &nbsp;However, where 4K streaming is rendered unavailable due to issues or limitations that are within our control, we will gladly reimburse you for the difference between the 4K package and the HD streaming package. We sell Event tickets on behalf of Event Organizers, which means we do not set the ticket prices. Event Organizers may also opt to offer merchandise via the Platform Services. In those situations, the Event Organizers or their retail vendors will determine pricing, and we will not control inventory or availability.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c3 lst-kix_list_5-0 start" start="5">
  <li class="c22"><h3>Order Confirmation and Processing</h3>Your order is confirmed when we send you a confirmation and/or additional event access credentials in the form of an e-ticket, confirmation page or email (&ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c12">Order Confirmation</span><span class="c7">&rdquo;). &nbsp;If you do not receive an Order Confirmation after submitting payment information, or if you experience an error message or service interruption after submitting payment information, it is your responsibility to confirm via your account whether or not your order has been placed. Only you may be aware of any problems that may occur during the purchase process. We will not be responsible for losses (monetary or otherwise) if you assume that an order was not placed because you failed to receive confirmation.</span></li>
  <li class="c19"><span class="c7">Service Fees, Order Processing Fees, Taxes, and Shipping Charges. &nbsp;Tickets and merchandise purchased on the Platform are subject to, among other possible fees, a per ticket service fee in the case of Event tickets, and a per item fee in the case of merchandise. We may display the applicable sales tax separately or include it in the total service fee amount. In the case of merchandise, you may need to pay a shipping or delivery fee. Any shipping or delivery charges are calculated based on delivery location and shipping method. Please note that all applicable fees may include a profit to Eluvio.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol class="c3 lst-kix_list_6-0 start" start="7">
  <li class="c16"><h3>Ticket Usage/Limitations</h3>Each Event ticket and/or its related access credentials (a "Ticket") will be valid to view the Event either when it initially streams or during such limited additional window after the initial streaming, or a combination thereof, as shall be determined by the Event Organizer and displayed clearly on the Platform at the time of purchase. &nbsp;Unless re-watch or on-demand capability is permitted by the Event Organizer, and except in the case of &ldquo;season pass&rdquo;-style Tickets, which may allow for viewing multiple events on the Platform, each Ticket will permit you a total of&nbsp;two&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) viewings of the Event, which may be conducted on up to&nbsp;two&nbsp;(2) devices&nbsp;at a time.&nbsp; The Event Organizer may also desire to permit holders of certain Tickets to create personal highlight reels from the Event, which may be downloaded and streamed either indefinitely or within a certain window, as determined by the Event Organizer and clearly displayed on the Platform at the time of purchase. Tickets are not transferrable and are not for resale; sharing Tickets with others will likely prevent you from viewing the Event yourself, and we reserve the right to cancel Tickets altogether if we detect that such Tickets have been transferred in violation of this Agreement. &nbsp;The Event is for adults only. &nbsp;You represent and warrant that you have reached the age of majority in the jurisdiction in which you reside.</span></li>
  <li class="c19"><span class="c4">NFTs and Media Wallet. &nbsp;Event Organizer may wish to issue to you an &ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c18 c12">NFT</span><span class="c4">,&rdquo; which is a one-of-a-kind, non-fungible, cryptographic token for which there is no copy or substitute and that is linked to and represents a particular copy of an item of digital content, including, but not limited to, a particular digital copy of any textual work, audiovisual work, motion picture, photograph, other image or musical or other sound recording (such digital content, the &ldquo;</span><span class="c7 c18 c12">Associated Content</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;). &nbsp;The issuance of any NFT to you would be recorded </span><span class="c0">on a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed on a network of computer systems, commonly known as a blockchain (the &ldquo;</span><span class="c8 c12 c18">Blockchain</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;). &nbsp;Any NFT issued to you will be stored, and may be viewed, publicly displayed and publicly performed, using Eluvio&rsquo;s applicable custodial service (the &ldquo;</span><span class="c8 c18 c12">Media Wallet</span><span class="c0 c5">&rdquo;).

  <li class="c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c5">In order to receive any NFT in connection with the Event, you will need to accept and agree to be </span><span class="c4 c5">bound</span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;by Eluvio&rsquo;s Media Wallet Terms of Use. &nbsp;Initially, you will not have any right </span><span class="c8">or </span><span class="c0 c5">ability to withdraw the NFT from the Media Wallet or otherwise transfer it in any way. &nbsp;</span><span class="c8">F</span><span class="c0 c5">unctionality to transfer NFTs from the Media Wallet </span><span class="c8">may</span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;be made available</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;in the future</span><span class="c0 c5">. &nbsp;Such ability to transfer may include the ability to collect payment for NFTs in the form of fiat currency (by credit card or debit card) or in any cryptocurrency that the Event Organizer accepts. &nbsp;The transfers may be recorded on the Ethereum mainnet blockchain. &nbsp;Other blockchains may be available for that purpose as well.</span></li>
  <li class="c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">Any NFT that you receive hereunder may be lost, corrupted, damaged or stolen or become inaccessible, and neither Eluvio nor Event Organizer will have any liability hereunder or otherwise arising out of or relating to the loss, corruption or theft of or damage to any NFT. &nbsp;Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Eluvio makes no representation or warranty that the operation of the Media Wallet or the Blockchain will be uninterrupted or error free, and your NFT may be entirely lost and inaccessible in the event of any interruption or error with respect to the Media Wallet or the Blockchain.</span></li>
  <li class="c17 li-bullet-0"><span class="c4 c5">An NFT is distinct from the Associated Content to which it is linked. </span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;Further, your receipt of an NFT does not mean, in and of itself, that you own or have any rights under any </span><span class="c4 c5">intellectual</span><span class="c0 c5">&nbsp;property rights, rights of publicity or other rights in or relating to such NFT or in or relating to any Associated Content. &nbsp;As between us and Event Organizer, Event Organizer is solely responsible for any NFTs that you receive hereunder, including any Associated Content. &nbsp;Thus, any license or other rights whatsoever that you may have under any of the intellectual property or other rights to copy, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, create derivative works or otherwise exploit Associated Content is a matter that is between you and Event Organizer. &nbsp;Eluvio makes no representation or warranty regarding intellectual property or other rights in any NFT or Associated Content and will have no liability or obligation to you whatsoever if your receipt, duplication, distribution, public display, public performance or other use of or activity relating to any such NFT or any Associated Content infringes or otherwise violates any intellectual property or other right of any person. &nbsp;However, this does not limit any of your rights relating to Associated Content or your NFT under your agreement (if any) with the Event Organizer.</span></li>
  <li class="c13 li-bullet-0"><span class="c0 c5">You agree that the regulatory regime governing Blockchain technologies and NFTs is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially affect your use of the Platform and Platform Services. You agree that we, or Event Organizer, may require you to provide additional information and documents at the request of any competent authority or in case of application of any applicable law or regulation, including laws related to anti-laundering (legalization) of incomes obtained by criminal means, or for counteracting financing of terrorism. We, or Event Organizer, may also require you to provide additional information and documents in cases where it has reasons to believe that: your Media Wallet is being used for any illegal activity; you have concealed or reported false identification information and other details; or actions effected via your Media Wallet were effected in breach of these Terms. In such cases, we, in our sole discretion, may pause or cancel your Media Wallet until such additional information and documents are reviewed by us and accepted as satisfying the requirements of applicable law. If you do not provide complete and accurate information and documents in response to such a request, we may refuse to provide you with access to the Platform or Platform Services.</span></li>

  <li class="c2"><h3>Canceled, Postponed, and Rescheduled Streaming Events</h3>If either the Event or our streaming of the Event via our Platform is canceled, no action is required on your part to obtain a refund; we will (via&nbsp;the digital payments vendor) issue a refund to the original method of payment used at time of purchase, once funds are received from the Event Organizer if applicable. In some cases, you may also be given the option to choose either a credit or a refund; if so, we will send you a notification explaining your options, and how to submit a request for a credit. &nbsp;If the Event, or our streaming of the Event, is postponed or rescheduled, your Ticket(s) are still valid, and no further action is required. If your Event is canceled, postponed, or rescheduled, we will attempt to contact you to update you on the status of the Event, and inform you of any refund, credit, or exchange procedures. For exact instructions on any particular canceled, postponed, rescheduled, or moved Event, please check the event information online and in your account (which will include the most current information on the status of the Event), or contact us.</span></li>

  <li class="c2"><h3>Refunds and Credits</h3>Unless otherwise expressly stated herein, or on the applicable Event page on the Platform, all Ticket sales are final and refunds will only be permitted in the limited circumstances described above.

[In the event that we or the Event Organizer provide the option to request a credit for canceled, postponed, or rescheduled Events, we will send you a notification, and you can submit a request for credit in your account.&nbsp;Credits are non-transferable, may not be sold, are not redeemable for cash, and may not be combined with other promotions. Credits may not be applied to previously placed orders &nbsp;Please note that if you are offered a choice of either a refund or a credit, you cannot get a partial refund; whatever selection you make (i.e., refund or credit) will apply to your entire order, and cannot be split between refund and credit. Any and all requests for a refund or credit are final and cannot be changed once initiated. &nbsp;All merchandise purchases made via the Platform are final, and in no event will there be refunds, exchanges, or credits for merchandise purchases. &nbsp;You agree that you will not attempt to evade, avoid, or circumvent any refund prohibitions in any manner with regard to Tickets or merchandise that you purchased.

Should you do so, your Tickets are subject to immediate cancelation, and we may, in our sole discretion, refuse to honor pending and future purchases made from all credit card accounts or online accounts on which such chargebacks have been made, and may prohibit future purchases from all persons in whose name the credit card accounts exist, and from any person who accesses any associated online account or credit card or who otherwise breaches this provision from using the Platform Services.</span></li>

This means that the FAA governs, among other things, the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration agreement and all of its provisions, including, without limitation, the class action waiver discussed below. State arbitration laws do not govern in any respect. &nbsp;This arbitration agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted and will survive termination of this Agreement. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to the extent permitted by law to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable. &nbsp;There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages) and must follow this Agreement as a court would. For the avoidance of doubt, the arbitrator can award injunctive relief. &nbsp;To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to: Eluvio, Inc., 918 Parker Street, Suite A21, Berkeley, CA 94710, Attn: President.

We will automatically reimburse administration and arbitrator fees for claims totaling less than $1,000 regardless of who the prevailing party is (unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous), but we will not pay for attorneys&#39; fees unless ordered to do so by the arbitrator. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in Alameda County, California. &nbsp;We each agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&#39;s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding, and that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.&nbsp;</span><span class="c7 c12">YOU AGREE TO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION</span><span class="c7">.
